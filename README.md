## ✨ About

This is a demo repository showcasing an AI/ML-based system for analyzing student behavior and learning patterns using the **VARK learning model**.

This repository is a **public demo** derived from the main **Student Profiler** project, which is maintained as a **private project**.

Student Profiler focuses on understanding how students learn and behave by combining:

* Behavioral data analysis with video analysis and human observation
* Learning-style classification
* AI/ML-driven insights

The system uses the **VARK model** (Visual, Auditory, Reading/Writing, Kinesthetic) to help identify preferred learning styles and support better educational decision-making.

> * **Initial dev release**: September 1, 2023
> * **Last review**: January 9, 2026

## 👀 What This Demo Includes

This demo repository provides:

* Sample project structure
* Example data flows and logic
* Simplified AI/ML concepts used in the system
* Demonstration code safe for public sharing

> [!NOTE]
> This is **not** the full production system.
> Advanced features, datasets, models, and integrations are intentionally excluded.

## 🧩 Modules

This mono-repo consists of several components acting as a cohesive system:

* **[studentprofiler-demo-web-app](./studentprofiler-demo-web-app)**: The main web interface for profiling and plan generation.
* **[studentprofiler-demo-mobile-app](./studentprofiler-demo-mobile-app)**: A mobile application built with Flutter/Dart for on-the-go access.
* **[studentprofiler-demo-bp-detector](./studentprofiler-demo-bp-detector)**: Behavioral Pattern Detector (Computer Vision for face/teacher detection).
* **[studentprofiler-demo-fer-detector](./studentprofiler-demo-fer-detector)**: Facial Emotion Recognition Detector (Deep Learning CNN model).
* **[studentprofiler-demo-sa-detector](./studentprofiler-demo-sa-detector)**: Sentiment Analysis Detector (NLP for feedback analysis).

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> * Some modules may contain simplified or placeholder implementations for demonstration purposes only.
> * Due to the sensitive nature of the original project, certain functionalities have been abstracted or omitted.
> * Also, there are no real datasets or trained models included.
> * You may need to adapt or extend them with your own datasets, models, and logic for real-world applications.
